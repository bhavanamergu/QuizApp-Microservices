Microservices-Based Application



Technologies Used:

Spring Boot – For building scalable and modular microservices

PostgreSQL – As the relational database for data persistence

Spring Data JPA – For seamless database interaction

Postman – For API testing and validation





Project Overview:

This project follows a microservices architecture, ensuring flexibility, scalability, and maintainability. Each microservice is responsible for a specific functionality and communicates via RESTful APIs.




Key Features:

✅ Modular architecture – Each service operates independently

✅ Spring Boot & JPA integration – Efficient data handling with PostgreSQL

✅ API testing – Using Postman to validate endpoints

✅ Scalability & Maintainability – Designed to handle future expansions
